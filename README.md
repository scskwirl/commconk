# Command and Conker
"Command &amp; Conker", an OpenRA mod inspired by Conker's Bad Fur Day.

It uses assets from both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert 1 among the famous warring factions of the Conker franchise, the Squirrel High Command and the Tediz, along with a third faction, the Weasels.

Under construction, this hasn't been updated in several years.

This is a fan project, fair-use only.
