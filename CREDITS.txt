Credits go to the following parties:

Westwood for making Command & Conquer happen.

EA for releasing the games for free for us modders to use.

Rareware for the Conker's Bad Fur Day inspiration and image/sound resources.

The OpenRA team for making this wonderful piece of software to mod and play on, and helping teach us how to mod with it.

Kanecvr, who made the "Tiberian Origins" mod used to get the GDI/Nod actors into the mod, because I had way too much trouble converting palettes. He also has nifty actors of his own in his mod but they aren't used here. Go try them out; it's fun.

Whoever else contributes to this.
