This is a quick to-do list for people to read and see what needs to be done to polish the game a bit.

PLEASE UPDATE AS NECESSARY

==

Reorganize each actor's traits in each YAML file (HOPEFULLY including each actor's given name instead of carry-overs from RA, such as how TLAB is Tediz Lab [techcenter], but Squirrel is still atek [allied tech].).

Redo the color palettes for the following:
Superfort icon
C17.shp
Apache.shp

Change the color of the Chemical Warrior's "flame" into a green color to represent chemical.

Test for building requirements for every actor.

Lots and lots and lots of graphic edits, namely for the icons, maybe for the Chromes for each faction (squirrels get woodland camo, tediz get stone, weasels get luxury black w/ silver trim, etc)

Probably redo tanya's voice to just the squirrel set.

Find unique gun/explosion sound effects.

Organize a whole new set of weapons (weapons.yaml) for each actor. For example, Stinger and Dragon were reused often in places and probably should not have been. Some duplications were made.

Now that three teams exist, come up with a cooler icon than the split-face squirrel/tediz icon.
